    "## 1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to football bets, for every single game, we have different bets houses (with different mathematical models) that are generating three different quotas for the three different results of that game (win home, draw, win away).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Img/introduction.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As it can be seen in the picture above, for the same game (Inglaterra vs Panamá), the three bets houses are offering different quotas for the three possible results of the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the times, this quotas are pretty much the same (for example, the three of them are offering 1.22 for Inglaterra winning, and more or less 6 euros for a draw). But, there are a few times when the mathematical models have big discrepancies. For example, for Panamá winning, in this cases, bet365 is offering 4 euros more than the other two bets houses. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this case, for the model of bet365 a win for Panamá is much less probable than for the other two bets houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind this project is to study this big discrepancies between bets houses and try to use them (if it’s possible) to predict the final result of the match.\n"

    "## 2. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The general objective of this project is increase the benefits in the management of bets of our customer. This will be achieved through the following specific objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a prediction model of results based on discrepancies between mathematical models of different betting houses for the same match, within the framework of a country and competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design of a method to identify matches with greater divergence between forecasts and therefore with more possibility of benefit if the result is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the reliability of betting houses, evaluating the success rate by comparing their odds with the result of the matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify if there is specialization of betting houses in a country, competition or team. Evaluate their highest success rate with respect to the different variables.\n",

    "## 3. Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "So, first of all, we need to get the data. Searching on internet we have found this page:\n",
    "http://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data in this page it is being updated every single week with the results of the games from that week.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Img/leagues_seasons.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a set of leagues divided between main leagues and extra leagues. The difference between main leagues and extra leagues is, basically, that main leagues have more bets houses than extra leagues. Within a league, we have all the different seasons (starting in all of leagues by 2003-2004 more or less). And, finally, within a season, we have all the results from that season distributed in different csv files (one for each competition).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get all this data, we have generated a python script that basically builds all the different urls of all the files and download all of them. Also, this script builds our own filesystem that has the following structure: Country > Competition > Season.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Img/download.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We download all the information but, by now, we have decided to use only the one coming from the main leagues as we have more information about bets houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from this page is very consistent, but, we have found some little problems. One of them is that not all the files in the main leagues has the same format. Some of them have more bet houses than others (depending on the country generally). Another of the problems is that not all the countries data are starting on the same season. \n",
    "So, basically, what we have done is to take a look in all the competitions and select a starting season from which we have information from all the competitions. Finally, to have the same amount of bet houses, we have created empty columns for the missing ones in all the competitions files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have join all this information coming from main leagues into a single file (keeping only le columns with valuable information) and exploit this data a little bit to get some interesting information as which is the bet house with more hit ratio, which are the bet houses that usually offer bets above or below the average...\n"

    "And finally we have implemented the function '**topNDivergence**' to obtain the top N matches with highest divergence and the top N matches with de lowest divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyse divergence values we have calculated histogram of its values. This measure has a binomial distribution with values from almost 0% to 80%, with a central value of 7-8%. Central quartiles are between 5,42% and 9,69%. \n",

The lowest of the quotas is what the bethouse has considered the most probable result for that match. Then, the computation is trivial: if __FTR__ is equal to the lowest quota, means that the bethouse has hit the result, otherwhise, not.
